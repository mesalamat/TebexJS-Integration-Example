# TebexJS Integration Example

Example showing the simplicity and prowess of the new [TebexJS]("https://docs.tebex.io/developers/tebex.js/overview") integrated Checkout together with the [Headless API]("https://docs.tebex.io/developers/headless-api")


## Usage

To be fair, this is just an example and very broken down but it can help establish an understanding about the TebexJS Library and the Headless API, as Official Documentation at times can be misleading or inaccurate.

The provided code though does lay a foundation for a one-product Checkout!
